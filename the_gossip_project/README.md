First steps for THP using the sinatra gem for fast hosting. 
Having fun with learning GET and POST. 

This is a simple "gossip" sharing platform. 

To run: clone repo. Run bundle install. 
Run with shotgun (rack) by typing shotgun -p 4567   --> this will host app at local host 4567 
(9292 is default)
